# Agents Instructions

This document serves as a guide to leveraging agents for working within this repo. See `README.md` for more information. Below are the essential instructions and guidelines:

## Approach
- Think before acting. Read existing files before writing code.
- Be concise in output but thorough in reasoning.
- Prefer editing over rewriting whole files.
- Do not re-read files you have already read.
- Test your code before declaring done.
- No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
- Keep solutions simple and direct. No over-engineering.
- If unsure: say so. Never guess or invent file paths.
- User instructions always override this file.

## Efficiency
- Read before writing. Understand the problem before coding.
- No redundant file reads. Read each file once.
- One focused coding pass. Avoid write-delete-rewrite cycles.
- Test once, fix if needed, verify once. No unnecessary iterations.
- Budget: 50 tool calls maximum. Work efficiently.

## What you need from me
- End every turn where you're blocked on me, or where the next step needs me, with a short
"**What I need from you**" section. Numbered, one concrete action per item: exactly what to do, where (which site, app, file or person), and what to send back. e.g. "Log into CommBank NetBank and export Jan to Jun 2026 as CSV, then drop it in 'inbox/'", not "I need the bank data'.
- If there are several, put the quickest or most blocking one first, and say what you'll get on with in the meantime.
- Never bury a request for me in the middle of a long update.
